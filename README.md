# Hand Gesture Recognition

## Project Overview

The Hand Gesture Recognition project is an AI-based system designed to classify hand gestures in real-time. The system identifies six distinct hand gestures (0 to 5), leveraging deep learning techniques and computer vision to process hand movements captured through a webcam. The project was a first-time attempt at training a deep learning model, and through this process, the challenges of data preprocessing, model training, and optimization were learned and tackled.

The system uses a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model, which is fine-tuned with custom layers added on top for gesture classification. The hand gestures are captured through the webcam, processed to extract hand landmarks using MediaPipe, and then classified using the trained model.

## Tech Stack

- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Used for training the deep learning model and performing model inference.
- **OpenCV**: Used for video capture and image processing.
- **MediaPipe**: Used for detecting hand landmarks and extracting key features from hand gestures.
- **MobileNetV2**: A lightweight pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) optimized for mobile and embedded devices, used as the base model for feature extraction.
- **Python**: The programming language used for the project.

## First-Time Model Training & Learning Process

This project marks the first time of training an AI model from scratch. It involved the following key learning steps:

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Collecting images for each gesture and preprocessing them to ensure the model could effectively learn from the data. Challenges included proper image augmentation and ensuring the dataset was balanced for each class.
  
- **Model Selection**: The project initially experimented with different deep learning models, and MobileNetV2 was chosen due to its lightweight nature and efficiency for real-time applications.

- **Training the Model**: The model was trained using the Keras framework with the MobileNetV2 base model. The training process taught valuable lessons in handling overfitting, selecting the correct loss function (categorical cross-entropy), and adjusting hyperparameters.

- **Model Evaluation & Optimization**: After training, the model's performance was evaluated, and iterative improvements were made to enhance accuracy. This included adjusting the data augmentation strategy and tuning the model's architecture for better generalization.

## Features

- Real-time gesture recognition through a webcam feed.
- Gesture classification for six predefined hand gestures (0 to 5).
- Deep learning model used for gesture classification.
- Hand landmarks extraction via MediaPipe for precise gesture detection.
- Data augmentation applied during model training to improve robustness.

## Applications

- **Sign Language Recognition**: The model can be used to translate sign language gestures into text or speech, aiding communication for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
- **Gesture-based Control Systems**: Can be applied in systems that control devices or software through hand gestures, offering an intuitive and hands-free interface.
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Enhances user interaction with systems by enabling gesture control instead of traditional input devices like a keyboard or mouse.

## Future Work

- Expand the gesture set to include more hand signs or complex movements.
- Enhance model performance by experimenting with different architectures and larger datasets.
- Implement real-time feedback or interaction mechanisms based on gesture recognition.
